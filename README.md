# NZQA Navigator

A simpler navigation for the NZQA assessment resources (past papers, assessment schedules, exemplars, etc).
NZQA have been kind enough to provide a [dataset](https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/list-of-standards-by-category-2020) for their assessment standards, which will be used as reference and updated in future years (hopefully).

## Intentions

- Minimizing the number of clicks to get to a given assessment.
- I will not store every PDF, they will be links to the NZQA website.
- Sorting things in an easy-to-understand way (level -> subject -> standards)
- Papers are listed alongside assessment schedules, exemplars, in a not really dumb listy way
- Browser-storage list of user-specific subjects for quick access
- A nice design, like practically all other government websites, my goodness NZQA, such a mess! (I understand there's probably a lot that would have to go on to change anything I'm really not that mad and this is supposed to be a simple tool)

## Structure

- Node.js RESTful backend
- HTML/CSS/JS frontend, probably bootstrap or some other fast frontend CSS/JS library
