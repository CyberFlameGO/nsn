                    <!-- <p>This journey began during exams last year. I built up an intense frustration at the number of clicks between going to the NZQA website, and the exam papers I needed for my study. I thought to myself <em>"There must be a better way!"</em> Then, after some research, I discovered that there was a dataset provided by NZQA, describing all their 106k standards that they've made since 1989. From here I'd imagined it would simply be entering this information into a database, writing a quick API to interface with that database, and serving that through a basic frontend. But lo! The dataset they provided didn't have information regarding what NCEA subject each standard fell under. So I went about my day, scraping the NZQA/NCEA subjects page for subject, then for each of those subjects, I would work through the "Search results" page for each level, building up a list of standards for each subject, that I would save in a JSON file. Then &mdash; shock! I discovered why that dataset didn't provide the subject for each standard. Standards can be a part of multiple subjects! Modifying my database to suit this, I moved forward. After many trials and tribulations, I ended up with a functioning site, with the following system diagram.</p>-->
